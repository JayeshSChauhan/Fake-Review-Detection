# Text Data Preprocessing

This document outlines the preprocessing steps applied to the text data, aimed at preparing it for analysis or machine learning tasks.

## 1. Data Cleaning

- **Removing missing values**: Any rows with missing or incomplete data are removed.
- **Removing duplicate entries**: Duplicate rows are filtered out to ensure no redundant information.
  
## 2. Text Normalization

- **Converting text to lowercase**: All text is transformed to lowercase to ensure uniformity and prevent case-sensitive discrepancies.
- **Removing punctuation and special characters**: Any punctuation marks, special characters, and numbers that are not necessary for the analysis are removed to focus solely on the words.

## 3. Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of splitting the text into individual words or tokens. This step allows for the analysis of each word independently, making it easier to work with the text data in subsequent steps. The reviews are split into tokens (words) that can then be analyzed or manipulated further.

## 4. Stopword Removal

Stopwords are common words (e.g., "the", "and", "is") that do not add significant meaning to the text. These words are removed from the dataset as they typically don't contribute to the analysis. Removing stopwords helps in focusing on the more meaningful words in the text.

## 5. Stemming and Lemmatization

Both stemming and lemmatization are techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form. 

- **Stemming** involves chopping off the suffixes of words to get the root form. For example, "running" is reduced to "run".
This step helps in grouping different forms of the same word and improving the quality of the analysis.

## 6. Vectorization

Vectorization is the final step in transforming the text data into a numerical format. Text data needs to be represented as numbers to be processed by machine learning algorithms. This is done using techniques like **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, which represents each word in the text by a numerical value based on its importance in the dataset.

## Conclusion

The above preprocessing steps ensure that the text data is clean, normalized, and transformed into a format that is suitable for further analysis or machine learning applications. After preprocessing, the data is ready for tasks such as classification, sentiment analysis, or topic modeling. 

These steps standardize the data, making it easier to extract meaningful patterns and insights.
