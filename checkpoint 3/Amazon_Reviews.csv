"Update 3 -- Some more updates on the Display. Checkout the article titled ""Avoid these subpar Panda LM156LF IPS displays"" on notebookcheck site for more info. Entry and Mid range Gaming laptop are not expected to have exceptional displays but that doesn't justify giving below average, cheap and outdated panel. Again the display in this is not so bad that it will ruin the experience in anyway but a better panel was expected.- Consider this as an entry level gaming laptop. The GPU is not as powerful as the Processor we have in this. If someone doesn't need a powerful CPU then they may also consider 5600H + 3050 combination if available cheaper for entry level gaming and on other hand for people not looking to game that much, 4800H + 1650 combination will also work. I am using this for development, coding and work related activities and casual gaming.- The best feature I liked till now of this laptop is its battery, Keyboard and led on them, plastic build quality, SSD speed and RAM & SSD expandability while display, audio, WiFi 6 and Camera could have been better.- Power profiles are auto switched by Asus's Armoury Crate software. It affects how fast battery is draining and laptop is heating. I found Windows profile to be best overall.-----------------------------------------------------------------Update 2 -- Battery backup is around 5 hours if not playing games- Finally the model started showing up in Asus promo website so I registered for 2 years extended warranty @ Rs. 999. But offer description says 1 Year Base warranty + 1 Year Extended Warranty so that part was confusing. I purchased it anyway, will update the once it arrives. May take up to 45 days.- Laptop has decent thermals, for detailed review I would recommend the review done by Venom's Tech on YouTube. It is the same laptop but different front color and design.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 1 (Edited) -Review after first few weeks of usage (non gaming review).- Keyboard keys are nice and led on them go super bright. No issues there. Touchpad was a bit rough initially but has smoothen out after continuous usage.- Laptop built quality is good, typical Asus Tuf kind. Extra vent opening in back just below 2 fans and side vents too (all side vents are open) on right side. Laptop has some good weight to it.- Camera is just average, don't expect much (0.9 MP, 720p)- Audio is on lower side. Need to keep system audio at 100% most of the time.- Max GPU Power draw I observed in HWiNFO was 77.3 W @1950 MHz under full load (plugged in). Max gpu temp reached 85.5 Â°C.- AMD Ryzen 7 4800H is almost 1.5 year old but still holds rank in top 50 in notebookcheck's cpu benchmark so it is good enough for me. Laptops having latest gen processor, that are higher ranked like 5800HS, 11800H, 5900HS, 5800H etc were no where close to this price range.- Fan noise under extreme load is decent, not too noisy. Rarely heard fan noise at all under normal usage like web browsing, development work etc.- Battery is too good for a gaming laptop,  Easily 5-6 hours backup under normal usage, with brightness @ 60%. Battery is from Asus (A32-K55) with full charge capacity of 92385 mWh- There are 2 SSD slots. SSD present is 512GB Hynix NVMe (PCIe 4x 8.0 GT/s) and other slot is empty so can expand. No HDD slots, that space is probably take up the long battery size.- WiFi 6 is from MediaTek (MT7921 Wireless LAN Card) with max speed of 866 Mbps. I believe some cost cutting done here. Not the best WiFi 6 hardware, more like entry level.- There are 2 Ram slot. One has 8GB DDR4 RAM from Micron and another slot is empty. Crucial CT8G4SFRA32A 8GB DDR4 (also manufactured by Micron) available here on Amazon may be a perfect fit for a proper 16 GB 3200Mhz Dual channel configuration.- Display left me with mixed feeling. Its old display from 2019 (Model - LM156LF-2F01 from Panda)Brightness is decent at 100%. Keeping at 50-70% for daily usage.  Sometime I feel colors are not accurate even for 45% NTSC, red seem like orange. But if not comparing with something like a smartphone its all fine and well on its own. Matte display and good under daylight. There is significant light bleed in top right corner of my unit but its limited to corner only and not spread so decided not to replace.- Display has two Refresh Rate options - 60Hz and 144Hz. On battery it auto switches to 60Hz.I tried for on going extended warranty offer at Asus @ Rs. 999 for 2 years but unfortunately the model number didn't show up on their registration page, I mailed them for same but till now didn't get any reply till now.So, All in all a good configuration for this price range. The processor may be old but the build design and manufacturing is of definitely 2021. Went with it because of the price point and battery. Rest all is good in this.----------------------------------------Reviewed on day I received -Just received it today.- Display is really 144Hz, although not mentioned on the box and the sticker for same is missing under the display- Battery is 90 watt hours- Adapter is 180 watts- Not Refurbished, As per the box it is Aug 2021 Import so brand new.So, In short the configurations mentioned in product description / details are correct.

"It's a very sturdy one.  However once in a while had issues in terms of lagging, auto rebooting. After 3 years of usage, it stopped powering.  I have to see what support is available

"To start i can say, I am extremely happy with the laptop as previous user of Lenovo laptop i give my entire overview of this laptop1. The laptop has decent processor which can survive upto next 4 to 5 years with medium to heavy usage.2. The display is good and brightness is also good not extremely bright or not dim as this is a gaming laptop. For content creators it might be insufficient but it does the job.3. I did not find the screen bleeding as an issue as i watched couple of movies in blue ray 1080p in pitch dark room and didn't find it as problem as you won't poke the screen day.4.The rx8gb 3200 ram does the job pretty much for all the games and takes and can be upgraded to 32gb dual channel Max. can use crucial 8gb 3200 to make 16gb as anything above that is over kill.5. The 512gb m. 2 ssd is pretty fast with boot times of around 9-10 seconds. It's a bit on lower side of storage but no HDD option is a draw back. 6.The ssd can be upgraded up to 4tb with 2tb Max per each slot. Installing both Ssd and ram is simple and easy and Removing the back panel and installing DOES NOT VOID YOUR WARRANTY. so you can do it7.The processor which is 8core 16thtrad is great and does the job very smoothly. You can easily use this for next 3 to 4 years medium to high usage.8.the graphic is good as i previously used 960m this is 3050rtx is a beast. Avg Fps on apex on 1080p high is around 80 and for Fortnite 120 fps without dlss and 130 with Dlss. I actually play these to games so tested with them9.the thermals are good you don't feel any heat on the keyboard. The fans exhaust is on the backside. I played the games for 3 hours and there are no issues it was smooth10. The keyboard has good key travel no flex on it. Very hard build. The display has metal panel and entire. Body is plastic so it has good build quality.11. the battery is huge and i got an avg of 5hrs in igpu mode with full brightness i did not have the time to test with normal gpu mode.. Will update after couple of days.12.the sound is average can't expect much as it doesn't have any dedicated manufacturer.Overall i can say the laptop is beast for its price point for medium to high gaming you can go for it blindlyFor productive work 16gb ram and extra 512gb is suggested. Adding that this laptop would one of the best ever for its price.
